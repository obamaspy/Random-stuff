        <p>I was in class and someone saw a map of France, and questioned why Luxembourg has such a long name for such a small country. I said(with quite good timing I Might add) “wait until you see liechtenstein” and no one laughed. When I make my regular hilarious geography jokes, I expect uproarious laughter from the student body. Is cancel culture ruining my comedy?   Log<sub>10</sub>20</p>
